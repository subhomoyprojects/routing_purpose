routing --- it is a concept through which we can pass from one link to 
another link in our application. Each link is connected with a component 
which is loaded when the link is active.
It is a process by which we can transmit to a perticular link path 
based on the routing rule.


React ----> routing ---> we need a third party module for routing in react.

module name :    'react-router-dom'

E:\React_Work\firstapp>npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0

Go to package.json ----> chcek

Link   ---- to generate the link we need this 2 components.
NavLink

import {Link,NavLink} from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to='/path'>Home</Link>

BrowserRouter --- they are used to define the routing rules for the routing.----we write routing
rules in App.js.
Route
Switch --- It is used only for nested routing 

import {BrowserRouter,Route} from 'react-router-dom';

<BrowserRouter>
<Route path='/path' component={Comp_name}/>
</BrowserRouter>
